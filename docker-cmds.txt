sudo groupadd docker
b. Add your user to the Docker group.

sh
Copy code
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
c. Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

Fix Docker socket permissions:
If the Docker socket file permissions are incorrect, you can correct them by running:

sh
Copy code
sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
sudo chmod 660 /var/run/docker.sock
Here is a step-by-step example:

Add your user to the Docker group:

sh
Copy code
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Log out and log back in, then verify:

sh
Copy code
docker ps
If you still encounter issues, use sudo:

sh
Copy code
sudo docker ps
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "permission denied" error and successfully run Docker commands.
